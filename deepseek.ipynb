            "\n",
            "Explanation: In this context, \"elbow grease\" is used idiomatically to mean hard physical effort or manual labor, rather than literally referring to grease applied to an elbow. The sentence implies that significant effort was required to restore the engine, not that actual grease was used.\n",
            "Compound：night owl, Sentence Type：Output: idiomatic\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In the sentence, \"night owl\" is used idiomatically to describe someone who stays up late at night and is more active during the evening or nighttime hours. It does not refer to an actual owl or a literal bird, but rather to a person's habits and preferences.\n",
            "Compound：heart of gold, Sentence Type：idiomatic  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: The phrase \"heart of gold\" is used idiomatically in this context. It does not literally mean that the person has a heart made of gold, but rather figuratively describes someone who is kind, generous, and compassionate. The sentence emphasizes that despite the private eye's flaws, they possess a good and caring nature.\n",
            "Compound：agony aunt, Sentence Type：Output: idiomatic\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In the given sentence, \"agony aunt\" is used idiomatically. An \"agony aunt\" typically refers to a person, often a columnist, who offers advice on personal problems. Here, it is used metaphorically to describe ESA's Space Weather Office, which provides advice and information about space weather, rather than personal issues. The term is not used in its literal sense but rather to convey the idea of offering guidance and support.\n",
            "Compound：shrinking violet, Sentence Type：Output: idiomatic  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: The compound \"shrinking violet\" is used idiomatically in the sentence. The phrase typically refers to a shy or timid person, but here it is used metaphorically to describe the wine as bold and assertive, contrasting with the literal meaning of the idiom.\n",
            "Compound：green fingers, Sentence Type：literal  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In this sentence, \"green fingers\" is used literally to describe the toddler's fingers covered in green paint. It does not refer to the idiomatic meaning of having a talent for gardening.\n",
            "Compound：ancient history, Sentence Type：literal  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In this sentence, \"ancient history\" refers to the historical events, cultures, and civilizations of ancient times, such as Greece and Rome. It is used in its literal sense to describe the study or influence of past historical periods, rather than as an idiom with a figurative meaning.\n",
            "Compound：banana republic, Sentence Type：Output: idiomatic\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In this context, \"banana republic\" is used idiomatically. It refers to a politically unstable country, typically in Central America or the Caribbean, that is economically dependent on a single export (historically bananas) and often characterized by corruption and exploitation by foreign interests. The phrase is not being used to literally describe a country that exports bananas, but rather to metaphorically criticize the political and economic state of the country as being corrupt and unstable.\n",
            "Compound：devil's advocate, Sentence Type：Output: literal\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In the sentence, \"Devil's advocate\" is used literally to describe Hinata's job role, which involves advocating for the Devil or working in the afterlife. This is not the idiomatic usage of \"devil's advocate,\" which typically refers to someone who argues a point they may not agree with, for the sake of debate or to explore an idea further. Here, it is a specific role within the context of the story.\n",
            "Compound：private eye, Sentence Type：idiomatic  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: The compound word \"private eye\" is used idiomatically in this context. It refers to a private investigator, not literally to an eye that is private. The phrase is a colloquial term for someone who conducts investigations discreetly.\n",
            "Compound：pipe dream, Sentence Type：idiomatic\n",
            "Compound：piece of cake, Sentence Type：literal  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In this sentence, \"piece of cake\" is used literally to refer to an actual portion of cake that someone is eating. It does not carry the idiomatic meaning of something being very easy.\n",
            "Compound：rocket science, Sentence Type：Output: idiomatic  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In the sentence, \"rocket science\" is used idiomatically to imply that the topic being discussed (basic business skills) is not highly complex or difficult to understand. The phrase \"This isn't rocket science\" is a common idiom meaning that something is straightforward or easy to grasp. It is not referring to the literal field of rocket science.\n",
            "Compound：brass ring, Sentence Type：literal  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In the given sentence, \"brass ring\" refers to a physical component made of brass, specifically a ring with axial protrusions and a central aperture. It is used in a literal sense to describe a material object, not idiomatically to mean an opportunity or prize.\n",
            "Compound：apples and oranges, Sentence Type：literal  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In the given sentence, \"apples and oranges\" refers to the actual fruits being cut up, tasted, and discussed. The phrase is used in its literal sense, not as an idiom meaning \"comparing two unlike things.\"\n",
            "Compound：nest egg, Sentence Type：idiomatic  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In this context, \"nest egg\" is used idiomatically to refer to a sum of money saved for future use, particularly for financial security during difficult times. It does not literally mean an egg in a nest.\n",
            "Compound：ghost town, Sentence Type：Output:  \n",
            "idiomatic  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation:  \n",
            "In the given sentence, \"ghost town\" is used idiomatically. While the phrase literally refers to an abandoned town, the context here suggests a supernatural or eerie atmosphere with \"restless spirits\" haunting the streets. This extends the meaning beyond the literal sense of an empty town, making it idiomatic.\n",
            "Compound：bull market, Sentence Type：idiomatic  \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: The term \"bull market\" is used idiomatically in this context. It refers to a financial market condition where prices are rising or are expected to rise, rather than its literal meaning involving bulls. The sentence describes a period of increasing stock prices, which aligns with the idiomatic usage of \"bull market.\"\n",
            "Compound：beached whale, Sentence Type：idiomatic\n",
